# Ingress

### AWS Load Balancer Controller
- If we select to go with ALB as loadbalancer, first we need to install AWS Load Balancer Controller 	
- AWS Load Balancer Controller reads that YAML file understands what is the exact requirement and it creates loadbalancer accordingly.
- AWS Load Balancer Controller. (It won't come by default.)
- In our case we need to create ALB controller
- ALB controller will look at the Ingress resource (yaml file) will create Loadbalancer
- AWS Load Balancer Controller is a controller to help manage Elastic Load Balancers for a Kubernetes cluster.
- The controller can provision the following resources:
- - - - - An AWS Application Load Balancer when you create a Kubernetes Ingress.
- - - - - An AWS Network Load Balancer when you create a Kubernetes Service of type LoadBalancer.
- Application Load Balancers work at L7 of the OSI model, allowing you to expose Kubernetes service using ingress rules, and supports external-facing traffic. Network load balancers work at L4 of the OSI model, allowing you to leverage Kubernetes Services to expose a set of pods as an application network service.
- The controller enables you to simplify operations and save costs by sharing an Application Load Balancer across multiple applications in your Kubernetes cluster.


### Installing ALB Controller
- Create IAM role with necessary policies
- Create OIDC
- Associate OIDC provider with cluster

### Disadvantages of using LoadBalancer service type
- It's not declarative
- Not cost effective because we have to create multiple LoadBalancer types.  That's expensive
- Cluster must have Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)
- By default CCM only create ALB. It cannot use Nginx, f5, Traffic Envoy

## What is the Difference Between LoadBalancer Service Type and Ingress?

### **LoadBalancer Service Type**
- **Purpose**: Exposes a Kubernetes Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
- **How It Works**:
  - Creates a dedicated load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB or ALB) for each Service.
  - Routes external traffic directly to the pods backing the Service.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to set up for exposing individual Services.
  - Provides direct access to pods via the load balancer.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Not Declarative**: Each Service requires a separate load balancer, which is managed individually.
  - **Costly**: Creating multiple load balancers for different Services can be expensive.
  - **Limited Flexibility**: By default, cloud providers may only support specific types of load balancers (e.g., ALB in AWS).
  - **No Centralized Routing**: Each Service has its own load balancer, making routing management more complex.

### **Ingress**
- **Purpose**: Provides centralized routing for multiple Services using a single entry point.
- **How It Works**:
  - Uses an **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB, Traefik) to manage routing rules.
  - Routes external traffic to different Services based on path or host-based rules.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Declarative**: Routing rules are defined in a single Ingress resource.
  - **Cost Effective**: Uses a single load balancer for multiple Services, reducing costs.
  - **Flexible**: Supports custom Ingress Controllers (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, Envoy) for advanced routing.
  - **Centralized Management**: Simplifies routing by consolidating rules in one place.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires an **Ingress Controller** to be deployed in the cluster.
  - More complex to set up compared to LoadBalancer Service type.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                     | LoadBalancer Service Type         | Ingress                              |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Exposes individual Services       | Centralized routing for multiple Services |
| **Cost**                    | Expensive (multiple load balancers) | Cost-effective (single load balancer) |
| **Routing**                 | Direct routing to pods            | Path-based or host-based routing     |
| **Declarative**             | No                                | Yes                                  |
| **Flexibility**             | Limited to cloud provider's load balancer | Supports custom Ingress Controllers |
| **Complexity**              | Simple                            | Requires Ingress Controller setup    |

### **When to Use Each**
- **LoadBalancer Service Type**:
  - Best for simple setups where you need to expose a single Service externally.
  - Suitable for small-scale applications or testing environments.

- **Ingress**:
  - Ideal for production environments with multiple Services.
  - Useful when you need advanced routing, cost optimization, and centralized management.

Let me know if you need further clarification or examples!


### Advantages of using Ingress
- It's created declaratively.  LoadBalancer can be modified, updated, add can use labels and annotations
- Cost effective.  One loadbalancer is enough for multiple microservices. Use path or port based routing.
- Not dependent on Cloud Controller Manager (CCM).  For non cloud we can use reverse proxy.
- Flexible to use multiple loadbalancer methods.  Nginx, F5, Traffic Envoy

### Understanding Ingess and Ingress controller


### Deploy the ALB Ingress controller


### Ingress
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /service1
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: service1
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /service2
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 8080
```


## ‚úÖ How IAM + OIDC + Kubernetes Work Together in EKS
#### üîß Setup Flow:
Enable IAM OIDC Provider for your EKS cluster
This allows your EKS cluster to issue tokens that AWS can verify using OIDC.

- Create an IAM Role
This role:

Has a trust policy allowing it to be assumed by tokens coming from the OIDC provider

Is not directly attached to the OIDC provider
‚Üí Instead, it trusts identities from the OIDC provider.

Associate the IAM Role with a Kubernetes Service Account
You annotate the service account like this:

```yaml

metadata:
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<your-role>
```
### üîÅ What Binds Them Together?
##### üîê The IAM Role's Trust Policy
It specifies the OIDC provider URL and matches the sub claim from the service account.
Example:
```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-cluster-id>"
  },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<cluster-id>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<serviceaccount-name>"
    }
  }
}
